# Pub/Sub API
The Pub/Sub API should have the 3 basic calls, but also be dependent on the user's following the structure of the Pub and Sub databases, so that misformatted messages can not be added to them. 
## Published

Published documents should follow a structure of:

* "upsert criteria"
* documents affected 
* and some other stuff
* The scripts already sent to

## Subscribed

Subscribed documents should follow a structure of:

* The query being listend for
* The user's subscribed to this query
