# Code Generator
This function is meant to be a way for users to implement the idea of reference codes or deals. 
Codes should be generated and have the ability to alter certain functionality based on what the code does. This has not been assigned yet because it is a large project in itself and I am still not sure of everything that it should do. It is also low priority, so it does not need to be done immediately. 

The code's should also be able to be attached to Assets and or groups, and could act as a way to join the group, or be discounted or earn credits or something. Idk.
