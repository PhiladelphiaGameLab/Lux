# Auth
This should be a set of files geared towards the different implementation of the core/auth.php for vairous authorization providers. That means that for:

* Google
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Ect

The file should consist of a function that is calling the core/auth.php functions in order to help log the user on. The Access_Keys and such should be stored in a config file in this folder which is being accessed by the individual files. core/Auth should be doing all of the processing
