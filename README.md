# lux Software Development Toolkit
## Intro

Lux is focused on creating an accessible environment for start-ups and front-end developers; allowing them to be more self-reliant and more focused on developing their technology at their speed. Lux is not just a back-end as a service, but a full suite of products that are integrated into a single package that allows for creation of products, services, and business tools with a strong online presence. Lux is built to be built to grow, every aspect of lux can be easily tied together, while still being treated as a separate entity. This ability to grow and change with it's needs allows lux to be a powerful tool, and  big reason to make open-source a staple in that tool.

### Resources needed



| Priority Level | Description | Jake's Est | Team Mi Exp | Team Max Exp |
|----------------|-------------|------------|-------------|--------------|
|  0 | lux should be use-able to build any simple application with or without client logins with limited end-user specific functionality. These would be primarily static websites or application's who focus on information distribution rather than on functionality (A database website, a registration, or corporate webpage).  | 17 | 34 | 66.5 |
|  1 | lux should be use-able to build any single player game or non-realtime multiplayer game. This would include turn based strategy games, longer term games, and any single player game. | 31.5 | 63 | 123 |
|  2 | lux should be use-able to build any multi-player game with realtime game play functionality, including MMO games and real-time strategy games. This section may need to be revisited to improve functionality- but relatively large sets of user's (on the scale of 5,000) should be able to play this game without server-side interruption *on a ec2 t2.micro instance*. A larger AWS Instance would scale this number appropriately with respect to the number of processors and processor speed. | 41 | 82 | 154.5 |
|  3 | lux should be capable of handling most games or applications, given the correct knowledge and usage.  This also concludes the FOSS portion of lux, and some functionality is possible through this section, but not as simple or as well handled as it would be with the proprietary portions of lux. | 55.5 | 111 | 218.5 |
|  4 | This is the basis for the lux proprietary model and offers the ability to launch and pay for a lux instance through a web interface, so that internal and external developers can begin using lux to create their own applications. | 81.5 | 163 | 293 |
|  5 | This level is meant to add value to lux proprietary on top of the FOSS and the ease of launching a FOSS instance in the form of more APIs that are still generalized for use in all applications.  | 99.5 | 199 | 356.5 |
|  6 | Priority 6 is meant to make launching and creating a non-technology business easier and faster in order to give incentive to use lux proprietary. These are APIs and tools more targeted at solving complex technology problems for non-technology business models. | 125 | 250 | 442.5 |
|  7 | This is meant to make rapid technology development more feasible on lux for less experienced front-end developers, who wish to build an application. The same tools can be used by more experienced developers in order to  more quickly build and deploy games and applications on top of lux. | 155.5 | 311 | 531 |
|  8 | This level is designed to target application's towards more developed companies, making it possible for them to deploy games and application's with an automatically generated API and automated testing procedures, making lux more appealing to large companies. | 185.5 | 371 | 616 |
|  9 | This level is meant to help developers monetize their applications through lux by providing easier access to integrated adverts and advert networks. This means that developers can build application's with passive revenue streams using only lux. | 224.5 | 449 | 724|
| 10 | This level is meant to help small businesses rapidly deploy products on top of lux with a minimal number employees, focusing efforts on functional game or application development. | 258.5 | 517 | 812 |
| 11 | These are only extra functionality to be added to make lux a full and complete package, as well as to increae the number of rapid development uses. This is the lowest level priority because most of these act as (almost) stand alone products which would need full development and are not really within the scope of this project. | $\infty$ | $\infty$ | $\infty$ |

**All of the above Estimations are in 1 person 8 hour days and are cumulative*
**Descriptions are what lux should be capable of doing after this level is complete* 


The specialized skills that may be worth hiring for (All short-stay hires) in the near future are listed below, although some skills may have been overlooked:

* Advanced Multi-Threading and distributed computing
* Advanced HTML/CSS/JS for front-end development
* PayPal/Stripe/ Any Online Payment Gateway system experiance
* Advanced Shell/CLI Programming ability
* UDP/WebSocket optimization
* Real-time Streaming protocols (RTSP) building experience (not just interfacing with an existing)
* Other languages (for implementation's of SDK libraries)

Other skills that are always helpful or **necessary** for lux developers:

* AWS SNS 
* AWS CLI 
* MultiThreading 
* Image Processing 
* **HTTP** 
* **HTML/CSS/JS** 
* UDP 
* RTSP 
* Google 
* AWS S3 
* **php**
* **WebSockets** 
* neo4j 
* MySQL 
* RegEx 
* GitHub 
* **Python** 
* **Mongo** 
* other languages 

### Open-Source
The lux project is an open-source project designed to grow and expand with the needs of the community. Contribution should be limited and monitored through GitHub, and will need a dedicated team to approve pull-requests from non-employee contributors. Affiliated contributors are in-house developers volunteering their time towards the lux project and maintaining the lux repository. The open source area of lux consists of the Back-end library on which applications are built, in this document they fall under the category of "API Calls For Lux".

The Open Source analytics platform is built into the API Calls For Lux, and is attached to it's own server-side processes. The Redux sections will be primarily open source, and given a marketplace around them- giving the ability to sell and profit off of redux functions. The data analytics framework is closed source, and not publicly available for modification. 

The Open Source Community behind Lux will help to ensure that all possible features are developed and included in the lux library. Although any technology could theoretically be built on lux open source alone, the community is encouraged to use the closed source software as well. 

### A note on Overarching goals
Many Backend as a Service providers are focused on singular platforms or application types- hence Game Backend as a Service, and Mobile Backend as a Service. lux is designed to be applied to any sector or industry that it needs to be. Another theme in Backend as a service providers has always been to solve problems by increasing the amount of server-side hardware being utilized. Although this solution is unavoidable- lux should be able to scale well on a small server, and should not need an increase in hardware as it's only solution.

lux, unlike other backend services, should also have a heavy connection to it's analytics that creates an environment which not only services users, but also provides useful feedback about them and their interactions with the system.  
 
### Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Terms 
* Developer: A developer working on top of a Lux instance to create an application
* Lux Developer: A developer working to develop Lux
* End-user: An application user who is using a third party application built on Lux by a developer
* lux Based products: Applications and Games Built on Lux.

### Scheme
Basic operations include:

* Upsert
	* Create
	* Edit
	* Remove
* Query

However for most APIs these should be broken down into finer detail, allowing only a few parameters to be altered with any given call. For almost all calls, the user should specify specific key->value changes to be made, and the php should handle those changes. In general, "Add" or "Create" and "Delete" should not be used, instead a function for "Adjust" should be used for editing an existing, and will create if one does not exist, "Adjust" can also remove whatever property with either a "remove" tag, or leaving the update field blank. Unless Specified as `~access_token`, all queries require an access\_token. If access\_token is optional (normally this changes behavior) then `~access_token?` will be used. Any GET request can also be a POST request, however POST requests can not be GET requests in all cases. 

Instead of Query, we should use get and fetch- where fetch is used when return value is dependent on user, and get is deterministic. Check should return a Boolean regarding the query (normally checking to see if a query is true or false)

The major exception to this, is Assets- which should be alterable via a direct Upsert so that they can remain as flexible as possible. For API wrappers (Social), the API should reflect the Social API as well as the users. The goal is to allow front-end developers to only use the lux API to create an entire application, and not need to interface with the server, or any other server, in any other way. 

### This document
This document is for the exclusive use of the lux team. Any alterations should be noted in the comments, and then after discussion the changes can be made. APIs in the first section are ordered by priority, however some leeway is permitted for ease of development purposes.  Please wait until you have discussed a section with the project lead before proceeding to build any aspect. 

Priority is listed in the title of every API, and currently range from 0-8. Priorities 0-3 are considered to be part of the open source project, and 4-8 are considered to be part of the proprietary lux software. Each API is also marked with a difficulty level:

1. Requires Only HTTP & Mongo Writes
2. Requires a class which can be added to other APIs
3. Requires Interaction with a non-Mongo database/third party service 
4. Requires Interaction with non-HTTP protocols to communicate with the End-User
5. Requires server-side scripts to be running which will need to be multi-threaded and optimized 

Priorities are superscripts $^x$, and difficulties are subscripts $_x$. Difficulty levels can be considered as the maximum number of days required to complete the section.

# API Calls For Lux
## Asset Management API $_1^0$ [done]
The Asset Management API allows users to create Assets and store them in a specific Asset Database. This allows access to the Database via the standard commands, which gives users full access to the collections. The Asset Database can be broken down by collections which are defined by the developer. This Database (and set of collections) are the only ones with arbitrary structure defined by the Developer. 

### API
* Upsert
	* Query || _id
	* Update
	* Remove
* Adjust- Key:Value
	* Query || _id
	* Key
	* Value
* Query
	* Query || _id
	* Resolve (boolean)
	* ~access_token?

### API Elaborations
A Query with no access\_token will only return documents who have global access specified. All queries however should check access before returning a document. APIs should strip out lux\_info

## User Management API $_1^0$ [done]
This API allows storage and creation of user documents, updating user values, and fetching the User's document. User documents should not be accessible via Upsert- but only Upsert- Key:Value and Fetch Me. Only a user should be able to access their own document, other user's should not have direct access to this document. If a User's profile information is to be made public to end-users, they should have a separate document for that in the User Profile API. This should contain log-in information, access_token, general system related info like settings. This is where their social access tokens are stored, however those are not exposed to the front-end. They should however be consistently refreshed so that they do not expire (unless they are given a lux expiration date). 

The difference between this and the User Profile API is that this information is protected/private information, so it should not be accessible outside of the server. Some information can be duplicated between this and the Users Profile API. 

### API
* Adjust (key->value)
	* email
	* name
	* phone number
	* Account Type
	* ect
* Fetch Me
* Adjust Profile Access Level
	* User _id
	* Level
* Adjust Account Suspension(User/Admin)

### API Elaborations
The key->value pairs are meant to be edited in user profile information. Change Profile Access level is an Admin functionality, and requires either dev access or the highest access level in the application.

## User Profile API $_3^0$
The User Profile API is part of the Social network and stores public information about the user that can be accessed by any user who is authorized in the system. Information availability can be limited further by setting permissions on certain parts of a profile. This information is stored in the social network (neo4j), and not in mongo. 

### API
* Adjust (key->value):
	* About
	* age_range
	* bio
	* birthday
	* context
	* photo
	* education
	* email
	* favorites
	* first_name
	* gender
	* hometown
	* inspirations
	* website
	* ect
* Fetch Me

## User Asset Ownership API $_2^0$
The User Ownership API is designed to track what Asset's a user is permitted to update. This API is designed to be hooked into the User Profile Document, and should automatically be checked from the Assets API to see if the user has proper permissions to change that Asset. 

Some Assets will be globally alterable, and should thus be stored under a Global User. Some assets will be alterable by multiple users, and will therefore need multiple users to reference the Assset's Id.

### API
* Adjust Permission level
* Fetch Permission level
* Fetch Owned Assets
* Get Asset's Owner
* Get User's Assets


### API Elaborations
Get User's Assets refers to getting assets that another user owns (public assets only). Fetch Permission level is the permission level that the User has on the Asset/

## Scoreboard $_1^0$
Scoreboard allows developers to easily keep track of user's score and Game state on a user By User bases. This is what is used by Leaderboard to asses user scores. 

### API
* Adjust Level Array 
* Adjust Level
* Adjust Metric
* Adjust item
* fetch User Scoreboard
* fetch user statistics
* fetch user items


### API Elaborations
Adjust item should include functionality to "Use" an item. Some items can be used multiple times- so creating an item should require a value of how often an item can be used, with a default of 1. 

Adjust Level Array is to create an array that can be used, like: levels, checkpoints, ect.

## Real-Time Updates (Websockets and UDP)  $_4^0$
Real-time updates allow users to receive all Updates to the Asset Collection which match queries they are subscribed to over WebSockets or UDP. This will follow the existing architecture, but with improved threading ability and no-sticking or faulting. 

### API
* Query
* Upsert
* Subscribe
* Unsubscribe

### API Elaborations
All of the Upserts and queries are in reference to the Asset Database, other parameters need to be changed via HTTP requests for now. It is important that this functionality work well- and on a large scale, even with a small (single core) server.

## Template Engine Render (Jade, Markdown, JMU [JSON MarkUp]) $_3^1$
This Service allows developers to query for a document and have it rendered into HTML, pdf, or another format before it is delivered to the End-User. This service will also connect to the CMS, to pull content items. The Template render should also include routing options to tell HTTP requests which file should be accessed. 

The initial implementation only needs to handle Rendering HTML, and needs to be able to handle routing problems. 

### API
* Fetch Page
* Change Render Settings

### API Elaborations
Content From the hooks are pulled from the CMS service. Multiple Pages can be concatenated in order to allow headers and footers to be used. 

The flow is: fetch page, switch out content, render as html, echo to page. Mustache style loops can be implemented for information that may be variable (a list or items or time entries).

## Session Management $_1^1$
The Sesssion management system allows specific devices to save session variables (mobile, web, ect) on the server-side, so that when moving between pages/sections, or if there is a disconnect- then variables can be saved. Developers can also save access_tokens in the session so that user's who leave the page for extended periods do not need to loose temporary data. Session is the only thing that is validated by the requesting device and not the user's access token. Devices that can hold cookies can also use a cookie as the identifier for a session. All session information is written into Mongo on each call- in order to save sessions for extended periods (without adjusting php attributes).

\$LF should also be able to access session info automatically in any other API.

Sessions are held in both the Mongo DB and the PHP Session.

### API
* Adjust attribute 
* Fetch session
* Fetch attribute
* Renew Session
* Adjust attribute timeout
* Adjust Session Timeout
* Fetch attribute
* Annihilate Session
* Mimic User Session (admin)

### API Elaborations
Adjust Session Attribute should create a new session if none exists. Sessions are accessible via an "id". The Session tool can be used to store anything and if a session id is passed into another API then $LF should access the session variables associated with it. 

Mimic User Session is accessible only via the admin, and returns the session variables for a particular user.  Lux info should be stripped out when the whole session is requested by the javascipt

## Social 
The Social API allows users to post to a variety of social media outlets from the Front-end, and allows Lux to track those social media postings. A developer should only need to send a single request to Lux in order to Post... whatever... and then the post should be processed By Lux- including access tokens, refresh tokens, ect.

The API should open up any functionality of the Social Media outlets API that is necessary- posting to their wall, getting their likes, ect... Developers should not need to connect to the Social Media API at all, but instead run all functions via Lux.

## Ad Exchange/Network/Cross Promotion API
The Differences between these 3 boils down to where the ads are sourced from/how much is being paid for them, but the API would be wrapped into one- allowing you to pull ads based on the user, the page, ect. The API would determine (based on your criteria, and your account) which ad should be displayed. The ad Exchange/Network/Cross Promotion Portal would be located on the Lux Intranet Tools, and allows users to both post ads and use them. The Ad Portal should also be available outside of the Lux system, and linked to any Ad networks that we can link it to. The Ad Portal should be API based as well. 

### API
* Create ad object
* Create segment
* Create ad unit (object, segment, geo, type [video, graphic, image], size)
* Create GeoTag
* Fetch ad Unit (by segment, geo, ect)
* Fetch ad Object
* Report Ad

## Payment API
The Payment API is a method of integrating credit card payments into the site so they are naturally processed on the server- including setting up reoccurring payments, setting up future payments, processing credit cards, and automatically disabling features/access if payment is not processed. The Payment system can originally be a wrapper for the PayPal API, but later should be developed as a custom Direct Deposit payment system. The Payment system makes security crucial.

The newsletter API allow you to add or remove members from a mailing list- add or remove newsletters to be sent out, and is linked to the User's document, so that suspending their account will remove them from the list, and updating the email on their account can update the email on the list. Non-account emails can also be added to the list. The newsletter API automatically appends an unsubscribe link, and allows you to send HTML based newsletters or mass emails out to Users and Subscribers. This will use the Amazon Message Sending Service (the one for mass no-reply emails).

# Analytics

The analytics functions for lux are built on a few key concepts.  The first of these concepts is the Mongo+Hadoop architecture, and the use of Hadoop's MapReduce functions for processing Analytics data that is saved into Mongo. This allows for scalability within the lux, which means that as the application scales to multiple servers, hadoop can be used to process analytics on these servers. 

The Lux team would however prefer to replace the use of Hadoop with a similar architecture which is controlled by lux's built in scalability model. This new architecture would still use Mongo and the MapReduce model- but can either be a customized version of Hadoop or a new system all together. 

The second concept is the combination of event/trigger and integrated passive analytics. The passive nature of both analytics is that user's need not know they are being analyized (unless the developer wishes for them to be aware), and just their interactions in the system is enough to update the system. 

Analytics can be customized by creating new MapReduce functions, or triggering existing MapReduce functions with new variables. All analytics information can be accessed back into the application for adaptive environments, pulling back in user personality profiles, or even recommendations without developers needing to create custom algorithms.  

All analytics have an optional access\_token included in the request, which allows tracking based on the user's lux identity. If the access\_token is not included, then a temporary identity will be created for the user. This temporary identity is less accurate and may include the same user under multiple identities, but should not include multiple users in one identity. This may lead to skews in results. This identity is similar to a server-side Session. 

### Event/trigger Analytics
The analytics contained in this section need to be integrated into your application by the developer, but will be automatically processed by the scripts that run in the MapReduce architecture. This entire section is contained in a single call to `record.php` and we primarily provide standard codes for developers to follow. 

When an event is triggered in the developer's application, they should call record.php to notify the lux application that this has happened. For Event/Trigger Analytics, access to data is more manual and may need to be pulled through a standard call such as `fetch.php` or `get.php`. 

Events can be given a severity level which is measured from -100 to 100. For some calls this will always be 100, and for others (User Personality) the measured level becomes very important. 

| Event Object | Event Code | Trigger | Trigger Code | Desc |
|--------------|------------|---------|--------------|------|
| Application Loaded | 000 | Mobile | 0000 | Application was opened in a native Mobile wrapper | 
| Application Error | 001 | Error Caught in Code | 0000-0500 | An error was caught with a try:catch statement within the application code |
| Application Error | 001 | Error Caused Application Crash | 0501-1000 | A Crash Report was present upon Application start-up | 
| Application Error | 001 | Non-Fatal Error | 1001-1500 | Application does not handle the current state, or an unexpected state reached |
| User Personality | 005 | Extroversion | 0000-0999 | User demonstrated Extroverted personality traits |
| User Personality | 005 | Agreeableness | 1000-1999 | User demonstrated Agreeableness personality traits |
| User Personality | 005 | Contentiousness | 2000-2999 | User demonstrated Contentiousness personality traits |
| User Personality | 005 | Neurotic | 3000-3999 | User demonstrated Neurotic personality traits |
| User Personality | 005 | Openness | 4000-4999 | User demonstrated Openness personality traits |
| Custom Event Object | 050-999 | Custom Triggers | 0-1000 | Developer Defined Analytic's objects | 

#### Custom Event Objects
The custom event objects are anything that a developer wishes to track in the system, whether this be  the number of times that a user walks through a door in a game, or the number of times a user clicks a given button the page. These Custom Event Objects can still take full advantage of the MapReduce functions for whatever information they would like to know. 


#### App Promotion Campaigning Analytics
Analaytics that are tied to App downloads from Promotions, App opens due to promotions, and app engagement due to promotions. All of these tied in via an analytics Rest Call which allows an update to the analytics when an App is opened or a Promotional code is input. Promotional code analytics should be directly monitored via the back-end services. App views and app opens can be triggered automatically from front-end functionality. 

#### Crash Analytics 
Crash analytics allows you to view crashes and how they can be avoided. Works by sending an update when App is reloaded after a crash. 

#### User Analytics 
User analytics focus on user engagement, and game-play to see how the app is being used. This is the core of the Lux Analytics engine, and focuses on promoting a better App experience- as well as providing insights about the Application's user base. 

#### User Character Tree Analysis

#### Cohort/User interaction Analysis

### Integrated Analytics
Integrated Analytics happen without any developer interaction. 
They are based on existing lux features that can be altered and changed according to developer needs. An example of an integrated Analytics application is the use of Scoreboard, which developers use in their application, and need to update on a regular basis. When a developer does update the user scoreboard, this change will be reflected in their Analytics without needing to add any additional code.  

For integrated analytics access to information is available through pre-made APIs. 

#### Buy Tracking
This tracks the number of purchases and the number of downloads for an App, as well as the in-app purchases to see how to best monetize your application. 


#### E-Commerce Analytics
Similar to buy tracking, but is focused on the purchase of physical goods and is more closely tied to the shopping cart, wishlist, and order system.


#### Location Analytics
Location Analytics focus on using user data to find where the primary user-base is and how it grows, changes, and develops- as well as Where people are using the application (doctor's office, bars, at home). These can also be applied to in-game locations, and can be applied to both physical world and in-game locations at the same time.


#### App Store Analytics
Automatically pulls all app store information related to your app, including competition and more. Allows developers to see how their app does in different environments- and how it compares to similar competitor products.

# Lux Intranet Tool

The Lux intranet tool is geared to provide all intranet, business, and other tools that a company should need. The Business development tool is a subset of this. Any employee should be able to go to the intranet tool and perform all business tasks/job tasks that are necessary for the company. 

## Newsletter Tool
MailChimp or dada rip off. 

## Internal Chat tool
A tool to chat internally with other employees- anyone else who is on the intranet. Although this should be integrated with the intranet (inbox, chat stuff, video conferencing ect), it should also be available as an external application. 

## Programming Test
The programming test should be targeted at hiring specific programmers and is accessible outside of the intranet. Programmers should be able to take the test and share their results across multiple companies. Companies should be able to request a test directly for specific applicants. This acts as both a job board and a hiring tools built into the intranet. 

## Time Tracker
An integrated version of the WWTW tracker, this should log hours, vacation days, manage pay, request advances, ect, and should be linked with project management

## HR Tools
This should give people an interface with HR and hiring, as well as allow HR to manage payroll, time-off, and anything else. This tool should handle both complaints (including anonymous complaints), and Employee management. 

### Manage Corporate Access
Who gets access to what, who can change what, and who get's access to what in the Intranet Tool. Allows enabling and disabling of tools, emails, ect. 

## Accounting Tools
The Accounting Tools built into the Intranet should handle all employee 

### Receipt Tracking
Standard Feature

### Payroll
Standard Feature

### Contracts/Invoice Manager (Allow online paying)
Standard Feature

### Auto Reports/Tax Forms
Generate all necessary forms, pre-filled out with only a few questions. User's should also be able to fill out tax forms through the system, or export to various formats (Quickbooks, whatever people use to file taxes). 

### Billing 
Billing is just how people view and pay their lux bill- as well as where they can see a break-down of what they are being charged for. 

## Order Management System
The Order Management system should be hooked into the shopping cart and allow for users to see and manage order and order shipping. Ideally a partner entity could handle warehousing and shipping- but that is in the future

## Inventory Management System
The inventory management system should allow users to maintain inventory, view inventory and see inventory at 3rd party systems (amazon, ect), in order to manage production and supply chain resources. This is closely tied with the Order Management System

## Helpdesk and Feedback tools
The help desk tools are too allow site and application users to give feedback and help desk tickets, and the intranet tools are built in to help manage those requests. Some minimal database access is given- but needs manager approval for modifying. Database access is only available for a single user who is identified by a security code of some sort. 

## Internal Game System
This is just for fun, and provides a small mini-game system for inter office competition and games. Games are both Long term turn based, and short term realtime games, but are all geared towards creating a community within the company. Games can be added from an app store, and can be enabled on a user by user bases. HR has the ability to block user's from a game, and see how much game play is taking place. Credits can be earned and used for rewards which are managed by HR. 

## User Management Tools 
Suspend Users, look at flagged users

## Asset Management Tools
Look at flagged assets

## CMS
The Content Management system is designed to allow employees (with permission) to update the external page quickly and efficiently. 

## Lux Management Console 

### Manage Lux Instances
This allows users to create, destroy, and change settings of their lux instances. It also allows users to control who has access to their lux instances. Changes that require significant financial changes should need to be approved by accounting. 

#### Update Lux From Github
This is simply a button within the lux instance that allows you to update and or manage updates of the open source core technology- or choose to select a different branch/fork of the open source. 

#### DNS Manager/Routing Manager
This is to manage the Route53 and EC2 Routing. 

#### CPanel
The CPanel gives many options to manage the features of apache and control how aspects of a webserver are handled.

#### API Service Management
This allows you to register for and sign up for APIs. I would like to partner with various APIs to allow you to get an API key through Lux, starting with lux based products automatically generating API keys for new lux based products. 

# Lux XDE

## Hardware Design Suite
The Hardware design suite should be geared towards users to develop hardware, PCBs, and layouts. It is meant for product prototyping from within the lux system, and should include easy access to a variety of tools and services. http://123d.circuits.io/

### Hardware Component Creator
The Component creator allows users to add components with real values to a system- and allows components to simulate code execution. 

### Hardware simulator & Code simulator (Arduino/Edison)
The hardware simulator should test both Code and circuits so that an entire first stage prototype can be built for any product before any parts are ordered. 

## Pixlr Editor
This provides both vector and pixel art to be performed from within the web browser/intranet tool and allows users to save their work to the cloud, as well as make it available to other system users. 

### Favicon Generator
The same as the pixlr editor, but geared towards Favicons. 

### Graphic Design Generator
The Same as the pixlr editor but geared towards UI/UX design and vector art. 

## 3D CAD/Animation
A full CAD and animation software available online. 

## GistBox
The GistBox allows users to share code within their organization or externally directly from the the IDE. 

## Component Marketplace
The Component Marketplace allows users to share any Components that are not proprietary for use outside the company, as well as to grab any internal components that exist. 

## Ad Exchange/Network/Cross Promotion Marketplace
This provides a network for users to access the marketplace and find ads to either sell or display. Ads can be added to a cart for display, or uploaded for marketing. 

## Tools/Libraries

### Sonic
Sonic Libraries should be included for device applications, and should have a JS wrapper that allows developers to easily and quickly use sonic within an application. 

### GitHub Integration
Elements should be syncable with github and have a local git repository available. You should be able to perform Pull Requests and Merges from within the application, as well as be able to fetch new code. This means that each users code base should be connected to a fork of a master. 

### App Store/Submission
The should be a deploy application to send applications to the app store, and an update feature that can update applications when necessary. 

### OS/Browser Emulator
The editors should have OS and Browser emulators available which render the elements and you can interact with.  

### CMS Hooks
Libraries should be avalable to easily create CMS hooks in the format 

		{{content}}
		{{about}}
		{{link}}[href]

or something similar.

These will be interpreted server side to be converted into CMS content- either to be replaced on the server side, or replaced on the client-side. This can be used in conjunction with the template renderer. 

### Cross Platform Tools
This should allow code to be written in JS/HTML and rendered on the appropriate device in a browser wrapper, and as a stand alone webpage. CSS should be rendered separately for each device type- and targeted at working across all devices. 

### Hardware integration Tools
JS wrappers for device functionality like: camera, gps, ect.

### Localization Toolkit 
A few lines of code to set-up how often the device location should be updated on the server  

### Ad Integration Library
A few lines of code to include an ad into a space- optimized for the device dimensions, pulled from lux, and fit to the container. Ads that are not shown on the page will not be fetched- and fetching ads can be set to happen after the page loads (to avoid ad block). Ads can also be triggered before videos, or full page ads after a button is pressed.

### Mobile App Management Library
MAM is the ability to control who can use an application and who is allowed to open an application based on their credentials. 

### Mobile Device Management 
MDM is a library that allows a company to control a devices functionality because this app was downloaded. This can be tied to Mobile App Management in that some applications are unusable if the MDM application is not installed. 

### App Monetization/in-App Sales Library
Similar to device hardware libraries, this allows developers to redirect users to the app store and manage what purchases have been made in the app store.  

### Automatic Offline Handling 
Saves data locally when connection is not available and forwards it later- prevents users from doing anything that requires connection if one is not available 

## App Store Optimization
App Store optimization uses the SEO tags on a page to generate ASO tags for automatic app submission. 

## Automated App Testing
Once a test are loaded programatically and can be executed on the server at given intervals- which will generate reports and send them to developers. 

## Beta Testing Distribution Set
Beta Testing distribution allows users to deploy an app via a web link opposed to via the app store. The user can also create Beta Testing prompts which can be deployed as a user interacts with the application as a prompt. 

# IDE

## Program Language Converter

## Virtual Program Execution Environments (c9.io)

# ADE 

## Prototyping and Mock-up
Allows users to drag elements onto the page and convert them into HTML/JS code once the Mockup is done. 

## Story-boarding 
Like Mock-up, story-boarding allows users to specify which clicks will lead to new interfaces, and the "compile" will add those links and the necessary JS code to implement that functionality 

## UI Framework (Bootstrap)
A CSS/JS UI framework that users are given access to through the system- these are the standard elements that are available in the Prototyping/Mock-up and Story-boarding tools.

## Native JS Framework (jQuery)
The JS Framework will primarily provide libraries to be used within the application

## App Factory
The App factory allows users to grab pre-built templates and make alterations to them quickly and easily for a rapid release cycle.
