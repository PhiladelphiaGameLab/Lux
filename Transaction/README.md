# Transaction Server
The transaction server should function as a System wide bank. This includes sub accounts, bartering, and storage of both Assets (referenced), and "Currency". 

This can be useful in games, and websites that might earn points or add things to a wishlist. This functionality is seperate from that of the Scoreboard, in that the scoreboard is simply tracking the amount of points that have been earned- and is linked to levels, were as the Transaction server is capable of tracking points, currency, or Assets, however is not linked to the level that a User is on when the points are earned.
