# POI API
This API does not provide POI, but allows assets to be given "Locations" and allows querying to happen in reference to those locations. This means that you can query for assets and sort the results by distance, or some other criteria within a given distance. Developers are still expected to provide their own Assets/POI, the API just makes it easier to query for them.
